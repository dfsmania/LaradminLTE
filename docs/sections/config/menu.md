# Menu Configuration

The menu settings are managed in the `config/ladmin_menu.php` file. If this file does not exist, you can publish it by running the following command in the `root` folder of your Laravel application:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="DFSmania\LaradminLte\LaradminLteServiceProvider" --tag="config"
```
